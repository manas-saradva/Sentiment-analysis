## Introduction

Sentiment Analysis is a crucial task in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that involves determining the emotional tone behind a body of text. This project leverages machine learning techniques to perform sentiment analysis, which can be applied in various domains such as social media monitoring, customer feedback analysis, and more.

## Features

- **Text Classification**: Classifies input text into positive, negative, or neutral sentiment.
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle large datasets efficiently.
- **Extensibility**: Modular code structure allows for easy integration of additional features or models.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/manas-saradva/Sentiment-analysis.git
   cd Sentiment-analysis
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To run the sentiment analysis application:

```bash
python app.py
```

This will start the application, and you can input text to receive its sentiment classification.
